I've written a lot of Bezier code. Here I am doing it again.

This project is a little different, because I stick to non-rational Bezier. This is for working with SVG, not some
exercise in completism.

Contains Matrix, De Casteljau, and Bezier Basis solvers. These are equivalent, but I'd rather test against other
methods than tediously compare return values to hand-calculated results.
